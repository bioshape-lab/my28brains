## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run the Code ##

We use Wandb to keep track of our runs. To launch a new run, follow the steps below.

#### 1. Set up [Wandb](https://wandb.ai/home) logging.

Wandb is a powerful tool for logging performance during training, as well as animation artifacts. To use it, simply [create an account](https://wandb.auth0.com/login?state=hKFo2SBNb0U4SjE0ZWN3OGZtbTlJWTRpYkNmU0dUTWZKSDk3Y6FupWxvZ2luo3RpZNkgODhWd254WW1zdG51RTREd0pWOGVKWVVzZkVOZ0dydGqjY2lk2SBWU001N1VDd1Q5d2JHU3hLdEVER1FISUtBQkhwcHpJdw&client=VSM57UCwT9wbGSxKtEDGQHIKABHppzIw&protocol=oauth2&nonce=dEZVS3dvYXFVSjdjZFFGdw%3D%3D&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.wandb.ai%2Foidc%2Fcallback&response_mode=form_post&response_type=id_token&scope=openid%20profile%20email&signup=true), then run:
```
wandb login
```
to sign into your account.

#### 2. Create a new project in Wandb.

Create a new project in Wandb called "TODO".

#### 3. Choose the `main` file that fits your goal. 


#### 4. Specify hyperparameters in default_config.py.

#### 5. Run your `main` file.
For a single run, use the command:
```
python main_xxx.py
```

### 6. üëÄ See Results.

You can see all of your runs by logging into the Wandb webpage and looking under your project name "TODO".
