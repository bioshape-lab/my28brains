'''This notebook creates a hormone animation for the whole hippocampus structure.

First, we will load 
- the nondegenerate meshes for the whole substructure
- the hormone data

Next, we will take the first 12 days of the data, as this is the time period where progesterone peaks.
Then, we will organize both data from lowest hormone level to highest hormone level
And we will draw a geodesic between these to see the "characteristic shape change associated with changing progesterone"
