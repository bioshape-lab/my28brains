"""Speeds up parameterized geodesic regression with an intentional decimation scheme.

What this script does:
- Fetch a sequence of parameterized meshes, based on data specified in default_config.py
THEN
- Decimates the geodesic to a LOW number of points.
- Performs geodesic regression on the decimated geodesic.
- Uses decimated mesh slope and intercept as starting point for next regression.
REPEATS ABOVE STEPS UNTIL THE INTERCEPT IS CLOSE TO THE TRUE INTERCEPT.
- Compares the regression results to the true slope and intercept of the geodesic.
